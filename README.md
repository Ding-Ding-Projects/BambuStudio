# BambuStudio
Bambu Studio is a cutting-edge, feature-rich slicing software.  
It contains project-based workflows, systematically optimized slicing algorithms, and an easy-to-use graphic interface, bringing users an incredibly smooth printing experience.

Prebuilt Windows, macOS 64-bit and Linux releases are available through the [github releases page](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio/releases/).

Bambu Studio is based on [PrusaSlicer](https://github.com/prusa3d/PrusaSlicer) by Prusa Research, which is from [Slic3r](https://github.com/Slic3r/Slic3r) by Alessandro Ranellucci and the RepRap community.

## Official-source feature candidate

This branch reapplies the fork's existing native interface, project workspace,
printer workflows, Model Creator, localization, and documentation to official
Bambu Studio `v02.08.04.57`. The selected source files and their blob IDs are
recorded in the [reapplication manifest](docs/reapplication/source-manifest.csv).
The [adapter notes](docs/reapplication/loader-adapters.md) explain how project
opening and tab restoration differ from the previous fork source.

This candidate still needs a fresh build, package, saved-3MF opening comparison,
and interaction evidence. The earlier installed-release crash has not been
attributed to a specific source change. Existing release downloads should not
be treated as verification of this candidate.

See the [wiki](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio/wiki) and the [documentation directory](https://github.com/bambulab/BambuStudio/tree/master/doc) for more information.
